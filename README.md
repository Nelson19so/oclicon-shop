Oclicon Online Store

Clicon Online Store is a fully-featured eCommerce web application built with Django for the backend and enhanced with a modern, responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, SCSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It includes user authentication, product management, cart functionality, an admin dashboard, order processing, wishlist, and more.

This project showcases my backend development skills while also featuring a complete frontend experience. It can serve as a robust template for scalable, production-ready eCommerce platforms.
